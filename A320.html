    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
     The Airbus A320 is a narrow-body commercial airliner designed for short to medium-haul flights. 
     It was introduced in 1988 as a competitor to the Boeing 737 and quickly became popular with airlines 
     around the world. The A320 features a fly-by-wire system, which uses electronic signals instead of 
     traditional mechanical controls to operate the aircraft. This system allows for greater control and 
     precision in flight. The airliner can carry up to 180 passengers and has a range of over 3,800 miles, 
     making it suitable for a wide variety of routes. The A320 family has undergone several updates and 
     upgrades over the years, including the introduction of the A320neo (new engine option) which features 
     more fuel-efficient engines and improved performance.  
    </p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <P>
     The design of the Airbus A320 is known for its efficiency and innovation. The aircraft features a 
     narrow-body design with a single-aisle cabin that can seat up to 180 passengers. The cockpit is equipped
     with the latest avionics and fly-by-wire technology, which allows for more precise control and reduces 
     pilot workload. The A320's wing design, known as a "butterfly" wing, allows for greater fuel efficiency 
     and better lift at low speeds. The aircraft's engines are mounted under the wings, reducing noise and 
     improving fuel efficiency. The A320's cabin design is also notable, with larger overhead storage bins 
     and wider seats for passenger comfort. Overall, the design of the A320 prioritizes efficiency, comfort, 
     and innovation, making it a popular choice for airlines around the world.

    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
    <P>
     The A320 has excellent takeoff and landing performance, allowing it to operate from shorter runways 
     and airports with limited facilities. It also has a low noise footprint, making it a good choice for 
     airports with noise restrictions. The aircraft's engines are designed for fuel efficiency, reducing 
     operating costs for airlines.
