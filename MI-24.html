      The design of the MI-24 Hind is unique, with its tandem rotor layout and large cockpit. The

      and shrapnel. The helicopter's weapons systems are mounted on the sides of the fuselage, giving 
      it a distinctive look. Its large, powerful engines provide the thrust needed for both transport 
      and combat missions, and the helicopter's wide landing gear allows it to land on uneven terrain.
