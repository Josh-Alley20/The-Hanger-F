    <h3>GE 747 Testbed</h3>
    <p>
      The picture at the top of the page is of the GE 747-400 testbed whitch is a modified version of the 
      Boeing 747-400 that is used for testing new aviation technologies and engines. The aircraft has been 
      extensively modified with special equipment and instrumentation to allow for testing of various 
      systems and components. One of the most notable modifications is the installation of a large pod 
      on the left wing that houses a General Electric CF6 engine, which is used for testing new engine 
      technologies. The testbed is also equipped with specialized data acquisition systems that allow for 
      detailed analysis of flight data and engine performance. The GE 747-400 testbed has been used for a 
      range of tests, including the development of new engine designs, testing of advanced materials, and 
      evaluation of new flight control systems. The testbed's unique capabilities have made it an important 
      tool for advancing aviation technology and improving the safety and efficiency of commercial aircraft.
